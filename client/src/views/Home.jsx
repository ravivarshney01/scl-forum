          When it comes to supply chain and logistics, a lot of the people donâ€™t
          know what actually that is. The best way to learn about new things is
          to read about it and we at Edgistify have collected three years of
          ground intelligence that we want to share.

          So to do that we want a web application with mobile friendly UI where
          anyone can come and register. Users can login to that portal and post
          something about the industry. Other users can view the posts and the
          comments on the same. Author of the post can comment back or anyone
          can comment on the comment.
